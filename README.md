### Highlights
- A multi-view time series clustering approach is proposed to **localize forecasting models**.
- **Recurrence Plot (RP)**, **Gramian Angular Field (GAF)**, and **Markov Transition Field (MTF)** are used to generate diverse views of time series data.
- Introduces a novel **Optimal Fuzzy Multi-View Clustering (OFMVC)** method for effective time series clustering.
- OFMVC selects **informative views** based on **manifold learning** and **diversity measures**.
- The proposed approach **outperforms several state-of-the-art benchmarks** in forecasting tasks.
